## the things i used for this setup:

- [WSL(windows subsystem for linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
- [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- [Paddy theme for visual studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yile-ou.paddy-color-theme)
- [microsoft's terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [savemepls terminal color scheme](https://github.com/blue-clouds4/windows-dot/main/savemepls-colorsch.json)
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
- [winfetch](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch)
- [wallpaper](https://github.com/blue-clouds4/windows-dot/blob/main/images/wallpaper.png?raw=true)
- [oh-my-posh theme](https://github.com/blue-clouds4/windows-dot/blob/main/posh/themes.omp.json)
- [fonts](https://github.com/blue-clouds4/windows-dot/main/fonts)

### cool how'd i install some of these?

- you can get WSL from the microsoft store by searching up the distro of choice you'd like to use, for me i install debain
- install Rainmeter from its [homepage](https://www.rainmeter.net/). i used the default already present ones with mainly disk2.ini,etc. the sticky note-ish thing present is called [papernotes](https://visualskins.com/skin/paper-notes)
- the installation guide for neofetch is better to be followed from [here](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Installation)
- you can install winfetch via 'scoop install winfetch'. To install scoop you can visit [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh/). there are more than one ways to install winfetch with the easiest methods being scoop. please refer [winfetch at github](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch)
- for installation and setup of oh-my-posh refer this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxNLJsDKyU4&pp=0gcJCX4JAYcqIYzv)
- you can install the fonts the classic way, everyone knows that if you dont, please [google it](https://www.google.co.in/) (and btw i have mainly use bigblue-terminal font for my terminals). howd i add them to my vs code you ask? again, [google it](https://www.google.co.in/)
- the terminal color scheme is a copy of one half dark theme in the terminal configured accordingly to my wallpaper
- the posh theme has been recolored accordingly to my desired taste (i mean it looks really good)

<summary>how'd i add the savemepls-colorsch.json as my terminal theme?</summary>

<details>
you go to the settings in your windows terminal,thats what i used and made the theme for. if you're using any other terminal you're on you're [own](https://cdn-useast1.kapwing.com/static/templates/buddy-christ-meme-template-full-e34c6303.webp).
